### East and West hives

- Bees were flying!
- Apparently both colonies survived the winter so far, very exciting.
- Quickly checked feed and added 1/2 a pollen patty
- Doesn't look like they ate any of the sugar over the winter
- I've heard that they'll often eat it in the spring, so I'll keep an eye on it
