### East and West hives

- Both colonies are dead.

Not sure what happened here. End of Feb, they were flying. Saw them flying
up until the end of March. They had plenty of resources both colonies had
a couple of frames of honey and lots of dry sugar on top. Unless those resources
were too far away? The honey that was there was the furthest away on frames 1 & 10.
However, dry sugar was just on the top of the frames the cluster was on.

Both had plenty of dead bees still in a cluster. The quilt boxes were dry. The only part of the
hive that looked wet were the bees had their thoraxes sticking out of the cells.
I'm guessing that's due to decomposition and not water in the hive since the
frames were dry above, be low, and to the sides of the cluster.

My best guess at this point is that the weather went from warmish to cold again fairly
quick and maybe they just didn't get clustered up and warm quickly enough? I'll have
to review with my mentors and see if they have any insights for me.

I have two new nucs on order and should be here in mid-May. My plan is to put
these new colonies in the "orchard" instead of down the hill. This will give me
a chance to open up the clearing down the hill more so that hives would get
sun earlier in the morning.
