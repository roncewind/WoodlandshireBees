### Swarm

Had a deep and three mediums sitting on a pallet in the driveway waiting to get
cleaned out after the loss of our colonies. Apparently around 2 May 2025, a swarm
started moving into the boxes. By the time I returned from a quick trip to WSU,
there were bees in all four boxes. Since it was fairly cool out, I quickly
restacked the boxes on a level bottom board and added an inner cover. From what
I could see from this restacking all the boxes had 5 or more frames of bees in
them. They were filling some frames with nectar and cleaning out they dead bees
from the old colonies. In the next couple of days I'll do an inspection and see
what is actually in there at this point.  I'd wait a week or so, but I only have
a warm weather window for the next couple of days. I need to figure out where to
move them to, since the driveway isn't ideal.
