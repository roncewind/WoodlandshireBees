### Swarm

removed the deep box and shook nectar in the deep frames over the honey super.

- 4: added a honey super for them to build out some comb
- 3(pink): medium box. completely full of nectar, some pollen and capped honey
- 2(purple): medium box. 3 frame of brood: capped to eggs. all frames have been cleaned out from the deadout
- 1(yellow): medium box. 4 frames of honey, pollen and nectar. all frames have been cleaned out from the deadout. supersedure cell found here.

Overall, looks like a strong colony, lots of been. Very pretty deep yellow/orange queen.
I expect she's in the process of being superseded. I left the supersedure cell to allow for
the natural supersedure process.
