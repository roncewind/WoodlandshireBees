### Orchard apiary

Finally a bright and sunny day. I installed both nucs in their new hives.
Each nuc had 6 frames and a frame feeder.

### East nuc (hive heart 1)

- 4 frames of brood, eggs to capped.
- did not find the queen, but eggs show she's there somewhere
- 1.5 frames of nectar, honey, and pollen
- moved to a single medium and added a top feeder with 1L of 1:1
- colony was out flying, bringing in pollen.
- inserted empty drawn comb between the brood nest and stores
- added a partial frame of capped honey as outer frame
- inserted hive heart 1 for monitoring

### West nuc (hive heart 2)

- 3 frames of brood, eggs to capped.
- Blue marked queen, looked good
- 3 frames of nectar, honey, and pollen
- moved to a single medium and added a top feeder with 1L of 1:1
- colony was out flying, bringing in pollen
- inserted empty drawn comb between the brood nest and stores
- added a partial frame of capped honey as outer frames (1 & 10)
