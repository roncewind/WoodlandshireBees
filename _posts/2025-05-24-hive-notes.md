### Swarm hive

Quick look into the hive. They are building out comb and putting nectar into the super.

Top brood box which formerly was full of stores now has 4 brood frames: eggs,
larvae, and capped. The rest is nectar, pollen, and capped honey.

I only looked at a few of frames in the next brood box. Again, found eggs, larvae,
and capped brood. Along with a couple of frames of stores.

Next time, I need to look at the bottom brood box and see if they are doing anything
with it, if not, I'm going to move it to the top of the brood boxes.
