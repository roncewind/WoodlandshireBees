### Orchard apiary

Inspection of both hives and feeder check.

### East nuc (hive heart 1)

- All 1:1 taken.
- Single medium brood box had 8 or 9 frames of bees
- 5 frames of brood: eggs, larvae, and capped.
- Blue marked queen present
- 4 frames of stores, nectar, pollen, and some capped honey.
- Added new medium with mostly foundation.
- Sprayed new frames with 1:1
- Put on 1L more 1:1
- Watch the laying pattern of the queen. Seemed a bit spotty, but time will tell.

### West nuc (hive heart 2)

- Basically same as the Eastern hive.
- Notable difference is the laying pattern of the queen in this box seems better
- All 1:1 taken.
- Single medium brood box had 8 or 9 frames of bees
- 5 frames of brood: eggs, larvae, and capped.
- Blue marked queen present
- 4 frames of stores, nectar, pollen, and some capped honey.
- Added new medium with mostly foundation.

### TODO:

- Check feed tomorrow.
